## 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY - THREE OPTIONS

### OPTION 1: Automated Batch Cleanup (Recommended - Fastest)

```bash
# Step 1: Clone automation repo
git clone https://github.com/solomon-mh/security-cleanup-automation.git
cd security-cleanup-automation

# Step 2: Make script executable
chmod +x batch-cleanup.sh

# Step 3: Run DRY RUN first (no changes)
./batch-cleanup.sh
# Review cleanup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log

# Step 4: When ready, apply cleanup
./batch-cleanup.sh --no-dry-run
# Monitors and logs all operations
```

**Pros**: Fast, automated, handles all 27 repos, detailed logging  
**Cons**: Requires bash environment  
**Time**: 2-4 hours for all repos  

---

### OPTION 2: Manual Per-Repository (Safest)

```bash
# For each repo:
cd /path/to/repo
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solomon-mh/security-cleanup-automation/main/cleanup.py
python3 cleanup.py .

# Review changes
git diff

# Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "security: remove malicious code from supply chain attack"
git push origin main
```

**Pros**: Full control, manual review each step, safest option  
**Cons**: Slower, requires manual work per repo  
**Time**: 30-45 minutes per repo  

---

### OPTION 3: GitHub Actions Workflow (Most Transparent)

For each repository:

```bash
# 1. Add workflow file
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp deep-cleanup-workflow.yml .github/workflows/cleanup.yml

# 2. Push to repo
git add .github/workflows/cleanup.yml
git commit -m "ci: add security cleanup workflow"
git push

# 3. Go to Actions tab and trigger:
# - Set dry_run=true first
# - Review results
# - Re-run with dry_run=false
```

**Pros**: Built into GitHub, transparent, creates PRs for review  
**Cons**: Must set up for each repo, slower  
**Time**: 1-2 hours per repo  

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Do These Now)

### 🔴 CRITICAL - DO RIGHT NOW (5 minutes):

```bash
# 1. Change GitHub password
# https://github.com/settings/password
# Set a STRONG, unique password

# 2. Enable 2FA
# https://github.com/settings/security
# Use an authenticator app (not SMS if possible)

# 3. Check Security Log
# https://github.com/settings/security-log
# Look for unauthorized access attempts

# 4. Revoke SSH Keys
# https://github.com/settings/ssh
# Delete ALL current keys - regenerate fresh ones

# 5. Revoke PATs
# https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Delete ALL personal access tokens

# 6. Check Ethereum Wallet
# https://etherscan.io/address/0xa322E5f3
# IF SUSPICIOUS TRANSACTIONS: Move funds to NEW wallet IMMEDIATELY!
```

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY - Do within 1 hour:

```bash
# 1. Review repo collaborators
# For each repo: https://github.com/solomon-mh/REPO/settings/access
# Remove ANY suspicious collaborators

# 2. Check for unauthorized SSH deploy keys
# For each repo: https://github.com/solomon-mh/REPO/settings/keys
# Remove any you don't recognize

# 3. Check for unauthorized webhooks
# For each repo: https://github.com/solomon-mh/REPO/settings/hooks
# Remove suspicious webhooks
```

## 📊 WHAT WILL BE REMOVED

### Files That Will Be Cleaned:

✅ **eslint.config.js**
```javascript
// BEFORE (INFECTED):
import js from "@eslint/js";
...
export default tseslint.config(...);
// [MALICIOUS] global.i="A10-*4650"
// [MALICIOUS] const _0x499797=_0x1574;
// [MALICIOUS] spawn('node', ['-e', ...])

// AFTER (CLEAN):
import js from "@eslint/js";
...
export default tseslint.config(...);
);
```

✅ **.gitignore**
```bash
# BEFORE (INFECTED):
node_modules/
dist/
// [MALICIOUS] _0x499797=_0x1574
// [MALICIOUS] global['r']=require

# AFTER (CLEAN):
node_modules/
dist/
```

✅ **Build Config Files**
- webpack.config.js
- vite.config.ts
- next.config.js
- tsconfig.json (if infected)

✅ **Suspicious Font Files**
- public/*.woff2 (if >5MB)
- public/*.woff (if >5MB)
- public/*.ttf (if >5MB)

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION - AFTER CLEANUP

### Quick Check (2 minutes per repo):

```bash
cd /path/to/repo

# Test 1: No obfuscated code
grep -r "_0x[a-f0-9]" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules
# ✅ PASS if returns nothing
# ❌ FAIL if shows results

# Test 2: No Ethereum wallet address
grep -r "0xa322E5f3" .
# ✅ PASS if returns nothing
# ❌ FAIL if shows results

# Test 3: No process spawning
grep -r "spawn.*node" . --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null
# ✅ PASS if returns nothing
# ❌ FAIL if shows results

# Test 4: Tests still work
npm test
# ✅ PASS if all tests pass
# ❌ FAIL if tests break

# Test 5: Linting works
npm run lint
# ✅ PASS if no lint errors
# ❌ FAIL if lint errors appear

# Test 6: Build succeeds
npm run build
# ✅ PASS if build succeeds
# ❌ FAIL if build fails
```

### Full Verification (10 minutes for all repos):

Run the verification script provided in DEPLOYMENT.md to check all repos automatically.
